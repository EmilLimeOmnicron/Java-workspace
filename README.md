Started Project 1 7/7/2017
Product Inventory - Create an application which manages an inventory of products. 
  Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an inventory
  class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.

7/17 Prints out from the csv file. I still need to sum up the inventory value and ability to modify the csv.
